# Minesweeper
This application recreates the game Minewsweeper. All of the Logic is implemented using the C++ Standard Library and all of the Visuals are implemented using SFML. Features include Random Board Generation, Preloaded Board States, Debugging Mode, and a Bomb Counter. All User Interaction is done through either Left or Right Mouse Clicks.

# Minesweeper
This application recreates the game Minewsweeper. All of the logic was primarily implemented using the C++ standard library and all of the visuals were implemented using SFML. Features include random board generation, preloaded board states, debugging mode, and a bomb counter. All user interaction is done through either right or left mouse clicks.
